This React project demonstrates how to fetch data from an external API (https://randomuser.me/api/) and display random user details in a dynamic and reusable component. The project utilizes React hooks, such as `useEffect` and `useState`, to handle the API request and manage the component's state.

The `RandomUser` component accepts a `buttonText` prop, which allows customization of the button text. Upon mounting, the component fetches a random user from the API using the `fetch` API. The fetched user data is stored in the component's state using the `useState` hook. When the button is clicked, a new random user is fetched, and the component re-renders with the updated user details.

The rendered user details include the user's profile picture, name, city,state, and location.

The project promotes code reusability and flexibility by utilizing React's component-based architecture and the concept of props. By passing different values for the `buttonText` prop, the `RandomUser` component can be easily customized for different use cases.

Overall, this project provides a solid foundation for integrating APIs into React applications and showcases best practices for managing asynchronous data fetching and component state. It can serve as a starting point for more complex applications that involve fetching and displaying data from external APIs in a React environment.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
